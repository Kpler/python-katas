# Trip Service

This kata is taken from [here](https://github.com/sandromancuso/trip-service-kata/tree/master/python).

## Goals

The objective is to test and refactor the legacy `TripService` class available in `trip_service.py`. 
The end result should be well-crafted code that expresses the domain. 
We do not need tests for users (right now), we want to test only the logic contained in the `TripService` class.

## Rules

- **We can’t change any existing code if not covered by tests.** We can’t afford to break any existing behavior. 
- The only exception is if we need to change the code to add unit tests, but in this case, **just automated refactorings (via IDE) are allowed.**
