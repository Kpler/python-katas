# Python-katas

### Purpose?

This project has been done in order for us to train practicing good practices such as:
- Pair programming
- Mob programming
- TDD, tests pyramid
- Emerging design
- KISS, YAGNI and clean code practices
- Discuss team standards
- Put personal egos on the side
- others...

### Tools to use it

Mob timer advance timers:
- online: https://mobti.me/
- on local: http://mobster.cc/

Role playing mob programming: https://github.com/willemlarsen/mobprogrammingrpg#readme

### How?

Rotation time: 5 to 10 minutes. The more people in a mob, the shorter is better.
Changing driver:
- IntelliJ Idea use `code with me` feature when in pair programming - for free usage
- Visual studio code - extension `Live Share` and `Live Share Audio`
- Push-pull when changing driver

Call:
- Google meet
- Zoom - Advantage you can give control to others

Roles at a basic level:
- driver - person taking care of typing the code
- navigator - person in charge of leading the discussion with the team and to decide in case of a conflict between team members
- timekeeper - person in charge of the timer

After an hour, having a micro retro is a good thing: (3 words)
- how did it feel?
- Return on time invested between 0 and 3?
- what did we do that I feel we should continue to do more of?
